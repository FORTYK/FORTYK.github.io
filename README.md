# FORTYK.github.io

A small project I made for a course while I studied an AI course at the University.

When visiting FORTYK.github.io an AI generates an island using perlin noise, a filter consisting of a circular gradient, and a couple of thresholds.

To make it more interesting I defined rulesets that would place landmarks on the island.
